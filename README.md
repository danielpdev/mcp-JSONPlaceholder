# JSONPlaceholder MCP Server

A modern Model Context Protocol (MCP) server built with FastMCP that provides access to the JSONPlaceholder API - a free fake REST API for testing and prototyping.

## Features

This MCP server provides **Resources**, **Tools**, and **Prompts** for interacting with JSONPlaceholder:

### üîß **Tools** (Actions)
- **get_posts** - Retrieve all posts or a specific post by ID
- **get_users** - Retrieve all users or a specific user by ID

- **get_photos** - Retrieve photos, optionally filtered by album ID
- **get_todos** - Retrieve todos, optionally filtered by user ID
- **create_post** - Create a new post (simulated)
- **search_posts** - Search posts by title or body content

### üìÑ **Resources** (Data Access)
- **posts://all** - Get all posts as a resource
- **posts://{post_id}** - Get a specific post as a resource
- **users://all** - Get all users as a resource  
- **users://{user_id}** - Get a specific user as a resource

### üìù **Prompts** (Templates)
- **analyze_post** - Generate analysis prompt for a specific post
- **user_profile_summary** - Create comprehensive user profile analysis


### How to add it to cursor:
```bash {
  "mcpServers": {
    "jsonplaceholder": {
      "command": "/Users/danielpopa/Projects/work/mcp-server/cursor_runner.sh",
      "args": []
    }
  }
} 
```

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.10+
- [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) package manager

### Installation

1. Clone or download this project
2. The project is already configured with uv. Simply run:
```bash
uv sync
```

### Development & Testing

**MCP Inspector** (recommended for development):
```bash
uv run mcp dev server.py
```
This opens an interactive web interface to test all tools, resources, and prompts.

**Direct server execution**:
```bash
uv run python server.py
```

**Test API connectivity**:
```bash
uv run python test_server.py
```

### Claude Desktop Integration

Install directly into Claude Desktop:
```bash
uv run mcp install server.py --name "JSONPlaceholder API"
```

### Usage Examples

Once connected to an MCP client, you can:

**Use Tools:**
- "Get all posts from JSONPlaceholder"
- "Show me user details for user ID 1"
- "Search for posts containing 'dolor'"
- "Create a new post titled 'Test' with body 'Hello World' for user 1"

**Access Resources:**
- The client can load `posts://all` to get all posts as context
- Load `users://5` to get user 5's details as background information

**Use Prompts:**
- Use the "analyze_post" prompt with post ID 1 for detailed post analysis
- Use "user_profile_summary" with user ID 2 for comprehensive user profiling
